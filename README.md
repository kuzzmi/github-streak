# github-streak

The purpose of github-streak is to monitor a GitHub repository and collect short-term information about contributions, triggering a webhook based on the event.

# Use case

Example: you have a pretty active team and you want to gamify the workflow by displaying "Double kill!" message in a connected Slack channel, when somebody makes a double commit, or "RA-A-AMPAGE" on 6 sequential commits.

# To-do

* think about other use cases :)
* monitor BitBucket or other git repository
* monitor private repositories
...
